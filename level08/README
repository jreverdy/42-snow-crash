The executable file level08 reads a file and prints it, but it prevents any file containing the substring "token" from being read from. This is to prevent the user from reading the file ~/token which probably contains a password either for flag08 or level09. By creating a symbolic link using command "ln -s ~/token /tmp/token", we can read the token file by passing /tmp/token to level08.

Like in the previous exercises, the executable allows us to usurp the user flag08, which is why reading the token file is permitted.
The token file contains the password for flag08.
